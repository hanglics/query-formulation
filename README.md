# Query Formulation

The aim is to be capable of generating a search query automatically, given a set of relevant studies as input. 

This plugin is to automatically and objectively derive suitable queries which can be used as a starting point for query formulation, to derive more effective search strategies (higher precision while maintaining recall) than manually derived queries.

The method of this study is expected not to replace information specialists, but to provide
support by reducing bias and subjectivity in the search development process.
